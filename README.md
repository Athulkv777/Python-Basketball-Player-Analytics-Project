# Basketball Player Analytics Project
This project is a Python-based analysis of NBA player data, which examines player demographics, financial investment patterns, and team-building strategies across NBA teams. The data includes player attributes such as name, team, position, age, height, weight, college, and salary.
Project Overview
This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess and analyze the NBA dataset. The main insights focus on distribution patterns, correlations, and salary structures to explore how NBA teams invest in their players based on various attributes.

# Key Analyses
1.	Team Employee Distribution
Analyze the distribution of players across teams and calculate the percentage split of players relative to the total.
2.	Position Segregation
Group players by their positions (e.g., PG, SG, PF, C, etc.) and display the count distribution.
3.	Predominant Age Group
Analyze the age distribution to find the most common age group among NBA players.
4.	Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
Identify teams and positions with the highest salary expenditures, showing how investment varies by team strategy.
5.	Age vs Salary Correlation
Explore any correlation between player age and salary, with a visualization of this relationship.
